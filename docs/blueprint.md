## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0D2EB) to evoke trust and reliability.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), almost white, to ensure readability and a clean look.
- Accent color: Pale purple (#D0B4DE), subtly different to avoid starkness, yet contrasting in brightness.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined look; for all body text.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif font with a computerized, techy, scientific feel; for prescription titles.
- Use medical-themed icons (e.g., a caduceus) in a simple, outline style. Icons should match the primary color.
- Employ a clean, organized layout that mimics the structure of a standard prescription form.
